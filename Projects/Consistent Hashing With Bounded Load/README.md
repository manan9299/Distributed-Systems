## Consistent Hashing with Bounded Load

- This Report is based on the presentation done by me as part of CMPE 275 (Enterprise Application Development) reverse lecture.
- The topic for the presentation was Load Balancing.
- My research was based on a recent variation of Consistent Hashing Algorithm conceived at Google ([link](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/consistent-hashing-with-bounded-loads.html)) and how Vimeo used this algorithm in HAProxy to reduce the resources used by their memcache service by a factor of 8 times.
- Here is a link to their [talk at HAProxy conf 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idogSsWG6IE) and their [Engineering Blog](https://medium.com/vimeo-engineering-blog/improving-load-balancing-with-a-new-consistent-hashing-algorithm-9f1bd75709ed)


Here is a Youtube Link to my [Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUF5erIkBi8)<br/><br/>
(P.S. - The presentation was capped at 5 minutes so I had to skip some of the topics, but I am working on creating another video explaining the algorithm and it's implementation in depth)
